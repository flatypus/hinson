# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## Hi! I'm Hinson Chan! Nice to meet you here!

I needed a better portfolio site, and since I recently just spent a year working with React and Nextjs, I decided to see if I could build a better one! So this is it :)

## What is this?

So this is meant to be a clone of my existing MacOS development environment, but in a browser, built with React and TailwindCSS. I'll start with adding markdown files just for the text bits, then maybe I'll add some more fun stuff later. (I'm thinking maybe a terminal emulator? Or real-time chat in the discord app? haha)

Oh, before I forget! If you think this is kinda cool, be sure to check out the [repo](https://github.com/flatypus/portfolio)! I'm always looking for feedback and suggestions!

## Take me on a tour!
