# Credits

Of course, there's no way I made everything from scratch!

• The windows are created with [react-rnd](https://github.com/bokuweb/react-rnd)

• I'm using [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) to display the very text you see here!

• Also, shoutout to [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) for the markdown styling.

• Icons come from [octicons](https://primer.style/design/foundations/icons/) and [macosicons](https://macosicons.com/#/)
