# Hinson's Personal Website

This is the source code for my [personal website](https://flatypus.me).

## About

Years ago, I set out to create a site that could represent who I am, and found it exceedingly impossible. I wanted to create something unique, yet embodied the kind of person I was (and still look half decent.) This site was the culmination of that effort, a repository of both my character and my projects. It's as close as I can get to replicating my MacOS laptop environment, from working windows, file system, terminal, while still being customized with dozens of small projects.

The site includes:
- Working MacOS environment, Finder & iTerm
- [Live YouTube Music Tracker](https://github.com/flatypus/yt-music-status-tracker)
- Various blog posts I write
- My Stanford Dorm 3D scan
- US military budget visualization
- Play GeoGuessr against me!
